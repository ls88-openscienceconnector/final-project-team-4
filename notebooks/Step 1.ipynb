    "\n",
    "The quality of the data seems to be in accordance with FAIR principles. The data is easy to find as it is available on zenodo and has a unique DOI (digital object identifier) code which further implies its findability. Since the data is open access, allowing users to see both the raw data and the final results as well as the code used, it has very high accessibility as it is available to the public. It appears to be interoperable as the code is written in a python notebook which can easily be uploaded on a jupyterhub and worked on. The language used in explaining the data manipulations is very clear, further adding to the interoperable aspect of the data. In terms of reusability, the data has the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 license making it easy to be reused and distributed. \n"

Ultimately, bar charts were produced to see which factors had the greatest impact in determining a movie’s success. \n"
