Null Hypothesis: There is no particular way to determine a movieâ€™s outcome or success. 
Alternative Hypothesis: Certain features such as crew and actor scores can be used to predict the success of a movie. 

Variables used: Crew score, actor score, runtime and budget.

Test used: For crew score and actor score, we used t-test to check if the variable is statistically significant in determining the success of a movie. For runtime and budget, we used a scatter plot with a line of best fit and computed the correlation coefficient to see if the factors are correlated with movie success. 

Variables to group: Crew score and actor score were produced in the original study, after they were weighted by genre. The runtime and budget were additional variables that were not used in the original study, but variables that we tested to confirm the original analysis.
