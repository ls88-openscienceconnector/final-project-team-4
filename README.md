This project tries to reproduce the analysis conducted by Nima Zahadat and Kartikay Avijeet on datasets that contain information regarding movies. There are two raw data sets, which are joined to produce a cleaned data set. The original analysis consists of manipulating the raw data sets and using feature engineering to produce relevant columns and metrics that can be used as predictors for movie success. In our project, we will attempt to recreate the analysis by using the metrics created in the original project, and seeing if the results obtained in the original project hold true. We will also compare new metrics and produce visualizations to see if other variables might serve as better predictors for movie success. We will assess the reliability of the data, which although is obtained from Kaggle, the original source is TMDb which does seem to be reputable.
